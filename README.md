# Projection engine

The **Projection Engine** is a 3D graphics engine designed and written from ground up to be multi-platform and easy to use.

## 2. History

This engine started as a solo project on my vacation, but it quickly grew to something bigger. I was initially inspired by blender and already
had some experience with Unreal Engine 4 and Unity, so I decided to invest some time creating my own game engine where I could build my projects on, so, december
last year the Projection Engine was born, since then many big features came into existence and many more are coming.

### 2.1 Internal goals
- Learn more about UI/UX
- Better myself with code optimization
- Learn deeply openGL/WebGL
- Apply the mathematical theory I learned in college
- Create something usable for more people

### 2.2 Current goals
- Ability to craft and distribute scenes and interactive experiences on the Web or as an application.
- Build a community around development with this tool and for it.
- Fast way to prototype and test scenes.
- Take in consideration what isn't as good or easy to work with in other tools and make it better if possible.

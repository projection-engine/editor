## Projection Engine v2.X - Alpha
This version is a complete and absolute rework of the entire editor UI (maybe not design-wise).

### Changes

#### React -> Svelte
Moving away from React is centanly a difficult choice given that almost 7 months of work will need to be rewritten on a new structure
but thanks to the benefits that **svelte** offers it is justified.

This change is due to performance and code quality of everything ui related.

#### Webpack -> rollup
This change gives more control and performance while on development due to the way each framework operates.
But mainly because rollup is more ideal  for work with svelte.


### More soon...
